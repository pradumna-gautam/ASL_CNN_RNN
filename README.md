# ASL_CNN_RNN
Built a CNN+RNN Architecture to train the model on temporal as well as the spatial features of video sequence. â€¢ Trained CNN model to make predictions for individual frames to obtain a sequence of predictions or pool layer outputs for each video. Outputs was now given to RNN to train on the temporal features.
